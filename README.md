<H1> COP3530 - Project 3 - Ishaan Desai, Minh Pham, Rahul Sai Boggavarapu </h1>
This is the template for Project 3 repositories. It includes all the assignment instructions and documentation to help you use GitHub.

<h2> Run Instructions </h2>

1. Download and extract all files to your working directory. This includes main.cpp, SplayTree.h, the CMakeLists.txt, and all of the other folders. The .csv file with all of the cleaned data is in the cmake-build-debug folder, named CleanedCrimeData.csv. 

2. Once you extract all of these files, right click the folder, press “Show more options”, and then press “Open Folder as CLion Project.” This will open up the folder in CLion.
   
3. Open up main.cpp and run it! We included the CMakeLists.txt to make it easier for the user to run the program, and once you run it, you’ll be able to interact with the program from your terminal.
